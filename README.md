# Evidence-First Cyber Threat Intelligence

**HNX26PSI03 — AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence**

An explainable, evidence-first attack reconstruction engine that correlates heterogeneous security telemetry across users, devices, IPs, applications, files and removable media.

> **An anomaly is not an incident. An incident requires a coherent, evidence-backed multi-stage attack chain.**

## What the system does

```
Security Logs → Event Normalization → Entity Resolution → Behavior Signals
→ Temporal / Entity Correlation → Attack-Stage Reasoner → Evidence Coverage
→ Campaign Confidence → Incident / Silent → Timeline + Evidence + ATT&CK + Response
```

The incident-validation boundary is deterministic. ATT&CK is enrichment, and the optional LLM investigator runs only after deterministic validation.

## Demo attack

```
Compromised Account → Unusual Login → New Device → Sensitive File Access
→ USB / Removable Media Mount → Large Data Copy to USB → Validated Incident
```

## Evidence-first security model

- **Event anomaly score:** how unusual is one event?
- **Campaign confidence:** how strongly do related events form a coherent attack?
- **ATT&CK enrichment:** which known technique describes validated behavior?
- **LLM investigation:** how can validated evidence be explained to an analyst?

The LLM cannot create or validate an incident. Every validated stage must contain actual evidence IDs. Telemetry is treated as untrusted data, never as instructions. Entity conflicts, invalid temporal ordering and incomplete chains fail closed.

## Supported telemetry

- Windows Security 4624 / 4663
- Windows XML
- Sysmon 1 / 3 / 11 / 22
- Zeek conn / HTTP / DNS
- Canonical SecurityEvent records

## Phase 2 — False-positive battle

The scenario benchmark contains 13 cases covering malicious chains and benign lookalikes.

- **0 false positives**
- **0 missed validated attacks**
- All expected dispositions passed

Controls include authorized transfers, large benign backups, shared-IP collisions, ordinary sensitive-file access, standalone USB activity, partial chains, reversed ordering and slow campaigns.

## Phase 4 — Behavioral baseline

The behavior layer tracks historical patterns for source IPs, devices, applications, event types, activity hours and daily volume. Behavior novelty increases suspicion but cannot independently become campaign confidence.

## Phase 5 — MITRE ATT&CK

The project uses a pinned **MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise v19.2** catalog.

Current demo mappings:
- **T1078 — Valid Accounts**
- **T1005 — Data from Local System**
- **T1052.001 — Exfiltration over USB**

ATT&CK is enrichment only. An ATT&CK mapping cannot create or validate an incident.

## Phase 6 — Deterministic attack reconstruction

Validated incidents receive a causal reconstruction containing candidate stage evidence, temporal/entity compatibility, causal edges and reasons, selected event IDs, rejected decoys, reconstruction score, temporal validity and entity conflict count.

## Phase 7 — Grounded LLM investigator

The optional investigator runs **after** deterministic incident validation. Its sealed evidence packet contains the validated incident, reconstruction, ATT&CK enrichment and timeline. Claims must cite real event IDs and are checked by a deterministic validator. Missing provider configuration fails closed; there is no synthetic fallback.

## Phase 8 — Public dataset validation

Phase 8 has two distinct validation tracks.

### Public derived validation

Public security telemetry is normalized and evaluated without committing large raw corpora to Git. The harness reports source coverage and normalization results and fails closed when the expected real artifact is unavailable.

### Raw CERT r4.2 benchmark

The project executed the **raw CERT Insider Threat Test Dataset r4.2** benchmark using raw logon, device and file data plus the official answer-key data.

Verified raw file row counts:

- logon.csv: **854,859**
- device.csv: **405,380**
- file.csv: **445,581**
- insiders.csv: **191**
- malicious scenarios: **70**

Raw benchmark result:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Malicious scenarios | 70 |
| Project-compatible scenarios | 3 / 70 |
| Compatibility rate | **4.29%** |
| Identity-stage proxy recall | **100.00%** |
| Sensitive-stage proxy recall | **5.71%** |
| Exfil-stage proxy recall | **4.29%** |
| Ordered-chain proxy recall | **4.29%** |
| Compatible ordered-chain recall | **100.00%** |
| Benign windows sampled | 300 |
| Benign proxy chains | 7 |
| Benign proxy-chain rate | **2.33%** |

**Important:** 4.29% is a dataset/project compatibility rate, not end-to-end detector recall over all 70 malicious scenarios. Only 3 CERT malicious scenarios matched the current identity → sensitive file activity → removable-media evidence contract. All 3 compatible scenarios completed the ordered chain.

- `scripts/verify_cert_raw_layout.py`

## Phase 9 — Judge demo

The judge dashboard exposes detection, campaign risk, attack timeline, entity graph, stage-by-stage evidence, deterministic reconstruction, selected evidence, rejected decoys, ATT&CK intelligence, response actions, validation status and benign suppression.

The Phase 9 CI gate verifies frontend JavaScript syntax, the full-attack judge contract, clean-control suppression, adversarial partial-chain suppression and the complete pytest regression suite.

Phase 9 hardening was merged after the relevant Phase 2–8 and Phase 9 checks passed.

## Phase 10 — Evidence-coverage hardening

The Phase 10 experiment measured the effect of missing one mandatory stage from the known full attack. The original hard gate correctly refused to validate incomplete chains, but it exposed no explicit campaign hypothesis.

The hardened pipeline now separates **campaign hypothesis** from **validated incident**:

```
Partial evidence → Campaign Hypothesis → Analyst/watchlist
Complete evidence + deterministic validation → Validated Incident
```

A CampaignHypothesis contains:
- confidence
- observed stages
- missing stages
- exact evidence event IDs
- temporal validity
- entity-consistency score
- an explicit statement that it is **not** a validated incident

The final incident gate remains strict: incomplete chains cannot become validated incidents.

### Phase 10 baseline

Controlled single-stage ablation of the existing demo attack:

| Input | Original disposition | Hardened output |
|---|---|---|
| Complete attack | Validated | Validated incident |
| Missing identity evidence | Watchlist | 2-stage campaign hypothesis |
| Missing sensitive-data evidence | Watchlist | 2-stage campaign hypothesis |
| Missing exfiltration evidence | Watchlist | 2-stage campaign hypothesis |

The hardened implementation also refuses to manufacture partial hypotheses for slow-window violations or conflicting/shared-IP identity chains. The full regression suite remained green after the change.

Research motivation: incomplete evidence, long/slow attacks, heterogeneous logs and false positives are established challenges in multi-step event-log correlation and attack reconstruction. The project addresses the recall pressure conservatively by surfacing uncertainty before the incident-validation boundary rather than lowering that boundary.

## Data and provenance

Demo scenarios are intentionally small and controlled so the complete attack chain can be reproduced during a hackathon demonstration. Public validation is kept separate from committed demo data, and large raw datasets are not committed to the repository.

Raw CERT r4.2 execution uses externally acquired data and an official answer-key source. The repository contains the acquisition, layout-validation and benchmark logic rather than the raw corpus itself.

## Design constraints

The project intentionally avoids anomaly-only incident generation, ATT&CK-only detection, LLM-generated incidents, synthetic public-dataset validation, unsupported evidence references, entity-conflict incidents and temporally impossible attack chains.

**Evidence first, explanation second.**

## Resource declaration

Core stack: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, deterministic correlation/reconstruction, MITRE ATT&CK enrichment, optional grounded LLM investigation, and a JavaScript/HTML/CSS dashboard.

No proprietary evaluation data is committed to the repository.
